# Description:

MeetingMaker is a simple tool where multiple users can input their availability schedule to find overlaps. The idea is to offer a simple way to choose a meeting time, as fast as possible. We think this will be useful for Teams with variable schedules.

# Features:

MeetingMaker for users without accounts; events will be shared with a link; no authentication. We think this will create a good first impression, for users who do not like having many accounts.

  

MeetingMaker for users with accounts will have more features. Calendars are more secure as they are locked behind additional security. User profiles can have saved availability which can be automatically applied to events. Users can create Teams with members of varying rank and permissions. Logged in users can also opt into email notifications when a meeting is scheduled for their team, when one of their teams receives a new meeting request, or when a team leader.

The final product should include export of calendar event files, especially including outlook for business use.
